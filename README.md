# I-am-running
I will never stop,and I will be better.  
The first programming language I learned is C language. It is the first step of my programming life, although I remember little syntax of it.Later, I learned JAVA from a training institution. To tell the truth, I never thoutht about that I would love programming because I took in training just for a work. However, I could not leave programming now. I do not know when to start that they have been the most importment part of my life.
All of above, I will be better until the best to stand on the peak of the marvellous world.
Hello world!
